      Unit 1  Carbon and the Molecular Diversity of Life 
I. Importance of Carbon
Organic chemistry: branch of chemistry that specializes in study of carbon compounds
Organic compounds: contain Carbon (& H)
Major elements of life: CHNOPS
Carbon can form large, complex, and diverse molecules
 

II. Diversity of Carbon
It has 4 valence electrons (tetravalence)
It can form up to 4 covalent bonds
Most frequent bonding partners: H, O, N
II. Diversity of Carbon
Bonds can be single, double, or triple covalent bonds.

II. Diversity of Carbon
Carbon can form large molecules
4 classes of macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids
II. Diversity of Carbon
Molecules can be chains, ring-shaped, or branched
II. Diversity of Carbon
Forms isomers
Molecules have same molecular formula, but differ in atom arrangement
different structures  different properties/functions

Drug manufacturing:
Thalidomide =
“good” enantiomer  reduce morning sickness
“bad” enantiomer  cause birth defects
“good” converts to “bad” in patient’s body
Now used to treat cancers, leprosy, HIV

III. Functional Groups
Behavior of organic molecules depends on functional groups
Most common functional groups:
Hydroxyl
Carbonyl
Carboxyl
Amino
Sulfhydryl
Phosphate
Methyl
