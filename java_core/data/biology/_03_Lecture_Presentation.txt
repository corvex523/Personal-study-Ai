Carbon and  the Molecular Diversity of Life
Overview: Carbon Compounds and Life
Aside from water, living organisms consist mostly of carbon-based compounds
Carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form large, complex, and diverse molecules
A compound containing carbon is said to be an organic compound

Critically important molecules of all living things fall into four main classes
Carbohydrates
Lipids
Proteins
Nucleic acids
The first three of these can form huge molecules called macromolecules

Figure 3.1
Concept 3.1: Carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding to four other atoms
An atom’s electron configuration determines the kinds and number of bonds the atom will form with other atoms
This is the source of carbon’s versatility
The Formation of Bonds with Carbon
With four valence electrons, carbon can form four covalent bonds with a variety of atoms
This ability makes large, complex molecules possible
In molecules with multiple carbons, each carbon bonded to four other atoms has a tetrahedral shape
However, when two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, the atoms joined to the carbons are in the same plane as the carbons

When a carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds, the bonds angle toward the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron
When two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, the atoms joined to those carbons are in the same plane as the carbons
Figure 3.2

The electron configuration of carbon gives it covalent compatibility with many different elements
The valences of carbon and its most frequent partners (hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) are the “building code” that governs the architecture of living molecules
Figure 3.3

Carbon atoms can partner with atoms other than hydrogen; for example:
Carbon dioxide: CO2


Urea: CO(NH2)2

Molecular Diversity Arising from Variation in Carbon Skeletons 
Carbon chains form the skeletons of most organic molecules
Carbon chains vary in length and shape

Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen
Many organic molecules, such as fats, have hydrocarbon components
Hydrocarbons can undergo reactions that release a large amount of energy
The Chemical Groups Most Important to Life
Functional groups are the components of organic molecules that are most commonly involved in chemical reactions
The number and arrangement of functional groups give each molecule its unique properties

The seven functional groups that are most important in the chemistry of life:
Hydroxyl group
Carbonyl group
Carboxyl group
Amino group
Sulfhydryl group
Phosphate group
Methyl group

ATP: An Important Source of Energy for Cellular Processes
One organic phosphate molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is the primary energy-transferring molecule in the cell 
ATP consists of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups
Figure 3.UN02
Figure 3.UN03
Concept 3.2: Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers
A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks 
These small building-block molecules are called monomers
Some molecules that serve as monomers also have other functions of their own
The Synthesis and Breakdown of Polymers
Cells make and break down polymers by the same  process
A dehydration reaction occurs when two monomers bond together through the loss of a water molecule
Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis, a reaction that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction
These processes are facilitated by enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions
Figure 3.6
Figure 3.6a
Figure 3.6b
The Diversity of Polymers
Each cell has thousands of different macromolecules 
Macromolecules vary among cells of an organism, vary more within a species, and vary even more between species
An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers
Concept 3.3: Carbohydrates serve as fuel and building material
Carbohydrates include sugars and the polymers of sugars
The simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides, or simple sugars
Carbohydrate macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers composed of many sugar building blocks 
Sugars
Figure 3.7
Figure 3.7a
Figure 3.7b
Figure 3.7c

Though often drawn as linear skeletons, in aqueous solutions many sugars form rings
Monosaccharides serve as a major fuel for cells and as raw material for building molecules 
Figure 3.8

A disaccharide is formed when a dehydration reaction joins two monosaccharides 
This covalent bond is called a glycosidic linkage
Figure 3.9-1
Figure 3.9-2
Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles
The structure and function of a polysaccharide are determined by its sugar monomers and the positions of glycosidic linkages
Storage Polysaccharides
Starch, a storage polysaccharide of plants, consists entirely of glucose monomers
Plants store surplus starch as granules
The simplest form of starch is amylose

Glycogen is a storage polysaccharide in animals
Humans and other vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells

Figure 3.10ba
Figure 3.10c
Figure 3.10ca
Structural Polysaccharides
The polysaccharide cellulose is a major component of the tough wall of plant cells
Like starch and glycogen, cellulose is a polymer of glucose, but the glycosidic linkages in cellulose differ
The difference is based on two ring forms for glucose

Figure 3.11
Figure 3.11a

In starch, the glucose monomers are arranged in the alpha () conformation
Starch (and glycogen) are largely helical
In cellulose, the monomers are arranged in the beta () conformation
Cellulose molecules are relatively straight	

Figure 3.11b
Figure 3.11c

In straight structures (cellulose), H atoms on one strand can form hydrogen bonds with OH groups on other strands
Parallel cellulose molecules held together this way are grouped into microfibrils, which form strong building materials for plants


Enzymes that digest starch by hydrolyzing  linkages can’t hydrolyze  linkages in cellulose
Cellulose in human food passes through the digestive tract as insoluble fiber
Some microbes use enzymes to digest cellulose
Many herbivores, from cows to termites, have symbiotic relationships with these microbes

Chitin, another structural polysaccharide, is found in the exoskeleton of arthropods
Chitin also provides structural support for the cell walls of many fungi
Concept 3.4: Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules
Lipids do not form true polymers
The unifying feature of lipids is having little or no affinity for water
Lipids are hydrophobic because they consist mostly  of hydrocarbons, which form nonpolar covalent bonds
The most biologically important lipids are fats, phospholipids, and steroids
Fats
Fats are constructed from two types of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids
Glycerol is a three-carbon alcohol with a hydroxyl group attached to each carbon
A fatty acid consists of a carboxyl group attached to a long carbon skeleton
Figure 3.12
Figure 3.12a 

Fats separate from water because water molecules hydrogen-bond to each other and exclude the fats
In a fat, three fatty acids are joined to glycerol by an ester linkage, creating a triacylglycerol, or triglyceride

Figure 3.12b

Fatty acids vary in length (number of carbons) and in the number and locations of double bonds
Saturated fatty acids have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible and no double bonds
Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds
Figure 3.13
Figure 3.13a
Figure 3.13aa
Figure 3.13b
Figure 3.13ba

Fats made from saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats and are solid at room temperature
Most animal fats are saturated
Fats made from unsaturated fatty acids, called unsaturated fats or oils, are liquid at room temperature
Plant fats and fish fats are usually unsaturated

The major function of fats is energy storage
Fat is a compact way for animals to carry their energy stores with them

Phospholipids
In a phospholipid, two fatty acids and a phosphate group are attached to glycerol 
The two fatty acid tails are hydrophobic, but the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head
Phospholipids are major constituents of cell membranes
Figure 3.14
Figure 3.14ab

When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into a bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the interior
This feature of phospholipids results in the bilayer arrangement found in cell membranes
Figure 3.14cd
Steroids
Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings
Cholesterol, an important steroid, is a component in animal cell membranes
Although cholesterol is essential in animals, high levels in the blood may contribute to cardiovascular disease
Figure 3.15
Concept 3.5: Proteins include a diversity of structures, resulting in a wide range of functions
Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells
Protein functions include defense, storage, transport, cellular communication, movement, and structural support

Life would not be possible without enzymes
Enzymatic proteins act as catalysts, to speed up chemical reactions without being consumed by the reaction

Polypeptides are unbranched polymers built from the same set of 20 amino acids
A protein is a biologically functional molecule that consists of one or more polypeptides
Amino Acids
Amino acids are organic molecules with carboxyl and amino groups
Amino acids differ in their properties due to differing side chains, called R groups
Figure 3.UN04
Figure 3.17
Figure 3.17a
Figure 3.17b
Figure 3.17c
Polypeptides
Amino acids are linked by peptide bonds
A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids
Polypeptides range in length from a few to more than a thousand monomers 
Each polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids, with a carboxyl end (C-terminus) and an amino end (N-terminus)
Figure 3.18
Figure 3.18a
Figure 3.18b
Protein Structure and Function
A functional protein consists of one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a unique shape
Figure 3.19
Figure 3.19a
Figure 3.19b

The sequence of amino acids, determined genetically, leads to a protein’s three-dimensional structure
A protein’s structure determines its function

Figure 3.20
Four Levels of Protein Structure
Proteins are very diverse, but share three superimposed levels of structure called primary, secondary, and tertiary structure
A fourth level, quaternary structure, arises when a protein consists of more than one polypeptide chain

The primary structure of a protein is its unique sequence of amino acids
Secondary structure, found in most proteins, consists of coils and folds in the polypeptide chain
Tertiary structure is determined by interactions among various side chains (R groups)
Quaternary structure results from interactions between multiple polypeptide chains

Sickle-Cell Disease: A Change in Primary Structure
Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids on the polypeptide chain
A slight change in primary structure can affect a protein’s structure and ability to function 
Sickle-cell disease, an inherited blood disorder, results from a single amino acid substitution in the protein hemoglobin

What Determines Protein Structure?
In addition to primary structure, physical and chemical conditions can affect structure
Alterations in pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other environmental factors can cause a protein to unravel
This loss of a protein’s native structure is called denaturation
A denatured protein is biologically inactive
Figure 3.23-1
Figure 3.23-2
Figure 3.23-3
Protein Folding in the Cell
It is hard to predict a protein’s structure from its primary structure
Most proteins probably go through several intermediate structures on their way to their final, stable shape
Scientists use X-ray crystallography to determine  3-D protein structure based on diffractions of an  X-ray beam by atoms of the crystalized molecule
Figure 3.24
Figure 3.24a
Figure 3.24b
Concept 3.6: Nucleic acids store, transmit, and help express hereditary information
The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a unit of inheritance called a gene
Genes are made of DNA, a nucleic acid made of monomers called nucleotides
The Roles of Nucleic Acids
There are two types of nucleic acids
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
Ribonucleic acid (RNA)
DNA provides directions for its own replication
DNA directs synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) and, through mRNA, controls protein synthesis
Figure 3.25-1
Figure 3.25-2
Figure 3.25-3
The Components of Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are polymers called polynucleotides
Each polynucleotide is made of monomers called nucleotides
Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups
The portion of a nucleotide without the phosphate group is called a nucleoside
Figure 3.26
Figure 3.26a
Figure 3.26b
Figure 3.26c
Figure 3.26d

Each nitrogenous base has one or two rings that include nitrogen atoms
The nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids are called cytosine (C), thymine (T), uracil (U), adenine (A), and guanine (G)
Thymine is found only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA; the rest are found in both DNA and RNA

The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose; in RNA it is ribose
A prime () is used to identify the carbon atoms in the ribose, such as the 2 carbon or 5 carbon
A nucleoside with at least one phosphate attached is a nucleotide
Nucleotide Polymers
Adjacent nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds that form between the —OH group on the 3 carbon of one nucleotide and the phosphate on the 5 carbon of the next
These links create a backbone of sugar-phosphate units with nitrogenous bases as appendages
The sequence of bases along a DNA or mRNA polymer is unique for each gene
The Structures of DNA and RNA Molecules
RNA molecules usually exist as single polypeptide chains 
DNA molecules have two polynucleotides spiraling around an imaginary axis, forming a double helix
In the DNA double helix, the two backbones run in opposite 5→ 3 directions from each other, an arrangement referred to as antiparallel
One DNA molecule includes many genes

The nitrogenous bases in DNA pair up and form hydrogen bonds: adenine (A) always with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always with cytosine (C)
This is called complementary base pairing
Complementary pairing can also occur between  two RNA molecules or between parts of the same molecule
In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U), so A and  U pair

DNA and Proteins as Tape Measures of Evolution
The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are passed from parents to offspring
Two closely related species are more similar in DNA than are more distantly related species
Molecular biology can be used to assess evolutionary kinship
