AP Biology Unit 1Chapter 2: The Chemical Context of Life: Overview: A Chemical Connection to Biology* Biology is a multidisciplinary science.* Living organisms are subject to basic laws of physics and chemistry.* Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds* Organisms are composed of matter.* Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass.Elements and Compounds* Matter is made up of elements. * An element is a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions.* A compound is a substance consisting of two or more elements in a fixed ratio.* A compound has characteristics different from those of its elements.Essential Elements of Life:  C  H  O  N* About 25 of the 92 elements are essential to life.* Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen make up 96% of living matter.* Most of the remaining 4% consists of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur.* Trace elements are those required by an organism in minute quantities.An element’s properties depend on the structure of its atoms* Each element consists of unique atoms.* An atom is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element.* Subatomic Particleso Atoms are composed of subatomic particles.o Relevant subatomic particles include* Neutrons (no electrical charge)* Protons (positive charge)* Electrons (negative charge).* Neutrons and protons form the atomic nucleus.* Electrons form a cloud around the nucleus.* Neutron mass and proton mass are almost identical and are measured in daltons.Atomic Number and Atomic Mass* Atoms of the various elements differ in number of subatomic particles.* An element’s atomic number =  # protons, the number of protons in its nucleus.* An element’s mass number = p + n, sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus. * Atomic mass, the atom’s total mass, can be approximated by the mass number.Isotopes* All atoms of an element have the same number of protons but may differ in number of neutrons* Isotopes are two atoms of an element that differ in number of neutrons.* Radioactive isotopes decay spontaneously, giving off particles and energy.  Used in biological research as tracers, in medical diagnosis and fossil dating.The Energy Levels of Electrons* Energy is the capacity to cause change.* Potential energy is the energy that matter has because of its location or structure.* The electrons of an atom differ in their amounts of potential energy.* An electron’s state of potential energy is called its energy level, or electron shell.Electron Distribution and Chemical Properties* The chemical behavior of an atom is determined by the distribution of electrons in electron shells.* The periodic table of the elements shows the electron distribution for each element.* Valence electrons are those in the outermost shell, or valence shell.* The chemical behavior of an atom is mostly determined by the valence electrons.* Elements with a full valence shell are chemically inert.Electron Orbitals* An orbital is the three-dimensional space where an electron is found 90% of the time.* Each electron shell consists of a specific number of orbitals.The formation and function of molecules depend on chemical bonding between atoms• Atoms with incomplete valence shells can share or transfer valence electrons with certain other atoms in order to become stable.• These interactions usually result in atoms staying close together, held by attractions called chemical bonds. Covalent Bonds - Share pairs of electrons* A covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms.* In a covalent bond, the shared electrons count as part of each atom’s valence shell.* A molecule consists of two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds.* A single covalent bond, or single bond, is the sharing of one pair of valence electrons.* A double covalent bond, or double bond, is the sharing of two pairs of valence electrons.* The notation used to represent atoms and bonding is called a structural formula.o For example, H–H * This can be abbreviated further with a molecular formula. o For example, H2o Covalent bonds can form between atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements. o A compound is a combination of two or more different elements.o Bonding capacity is called the atom’s valence.* Electronegativity is an atom’s attraction for the electrons in a covalent bond.* The more electronegative an atom, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself.* In a nonpolar covalent bond, the atoms share the electron equally.* In a polar covalent bond, one atom is more electronegative, and the atoms share the electron unequally.* Unequal sharing of electrons causes a partial positive or negative charge for each atom or molecule.Ionic Bonds:   Transfer electrons* Atoms sometimes strip electrons from their bonding partners.* An example is the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine.* After the transfer of an electron, both atoms have charges.* A charged atom (or molecule) is called an ion.* A cation is a positively + charged ion.* An anion is a negatively - charged ion.* An ionic bond is an attraction between an anion and a cation.* Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called ionic compounds, or salts.* Salts, such as sodium chloride (table salt),  are often found in nature as crystals.Weak Chemical Bonds* Most of the strongest bonds in organisms are covalent bonds that form a cell’s molecules.* Weak chemical bonds, such as ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds, are also important.* Weak chemical bonds reinforce shapes of large molecules and help molecules adhere to each other.Hydrogen Bonds* A hydrogen bond forms when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to one electronegative atom is also attracted to another electronegative atom.* In living cells, the electronegative partners are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms.Van der Waals Interactions* If electrons are distributed asymmetrically in molecules or atoms, they can result in “hot spots” of positive or negative charge.* Van der Waals interactions are attractions between molecules that are close together as a result of these charges.* Collectively, such interactions can be strong, as between molecules of a gecko’s toe hairs and a wall surface.Molecular Shape and Function* A molecule’s shape is usually very important to its function.* A molecule’s shape is determined by the positions of its atoms’ valence orbitals.* In a covalent bond, the s and p orbitals may hybridize, creating specific molecular shapes.* Biological molecules recognize and interact with each other with a specificity based on molecular shape.* Molecules with similar shapes can have similar biological effects.Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds* Chemical reactions are the making and breaking of chemical bonds.* The starting molecules of a chemical reaction are called reactants.* The final molecules of a chemical reaction are called products.* Photosynthesis is an important chemical reaction. * Sunlight powers the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen.o 6 CO2 + 6 H20  -->  C6H12O6 + 6 O2o Some chemical reactions go to completion: all reactants are converted to products.o All chemical reactions are reversible: products of the forward reaction become reactants for the reverse reaction.o Chemical equilibrium is reached when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.o Atom:    Subatomic ParticlesYou should now be able to:o Identify the four major elements.o Distinguish between the following pairs of terms: neutron and proton, atomic number and mass number, atomic weight and mass number.o Distinguish between and discuss the biological importance of the following: nonpolar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions.Chapter 3: Water and the Fitness of the EnvironmentOverview: The Molecule That Supports All of Lifeo Water is the biological medium on Earth.o All living organisms require water more than any other substance..o Most cells are surrounded by water, and cells themselves are about 70–95% water.o The abundance of water is the main reason the Earth is habitable.The polarity of water molecules results in hydrogen bondingo The water molecule is a polar molecule: The opposite ends have opposite charges.o Polarity allows water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with each other.Four emergent properties of water contribute to Earth’s fitness for lifeo Four of water’s properties that facilitate an environment for life are:o Cohesive behavioro Ability to moderate temperature: Stableo Expansion upon freezing:  Less dense Ice floatso Versatility as a solvent.Cohesiono Collectively, hydrogen bonds hold water molecules together, a phenomenon called cohesion.o Cohesion helps the transport of water against gravity in plants.o Adhesion is an attraction between different substances, for example, between water and plant cell walls.o Surface tension is a measure of how hard it is to break the surface of a liquid.o Surface tension is related to cohesion.o Cohesion:   “like attracted to like” =  water is attracted to other water molecules.Moderation of Temperatureo Water absorbs heat from warmer air and releases stored heat to cooler air.  STABLE.o Water can absorb or release a large amount of heat with only a slight change in its own temperature  =  high specific heat.Heat and Temperatureo Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.o Heat is a measure of the total amount of kinetic energy due to molecular motion.o Temperature measures the intensity of heat due to the average kinetic energy of molecules.o The Celsius scale is a measure of temperature using Celsius degrees (°C).o A calorie (cal) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1°C.o The “calories” on food packages are actually kilocalories (kcal), where 1 kcal = 1,000 cal.o The joule (J) is another unit of energy where 1 J = 0.239 cal, or 1 cal = 4.184 JWater’s High Specific Heato The specific heat of a substance is the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1ºCo The specific heat of water is 1 cal/g/ºCo Water resists changing its temperature because of its high specific heat = STABLE.o Water’s high specific heat can be traced to hydrogen bonding.o Heat is absorbed when hydrogen bonds break.o Heat is released when hydrogen bonds form.o The high specific heat of water minimizes temperature fluctuations to within limits that permit life.Evaporative Coolingo Evaporation is transformation of a substance from liquid to gas.o Heat of vaporization is the heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g to be converted to gas.o As a liquid evaporates, its remaining surface cools, a process called evaporative cooling. o Evaporative cooling of water helps stabilize temperatures in organisms and bodies of water.Insulation of Bodies of Water by Floating Iceo Ice floats in liquid water because hydrogen bonds in ice are more “ordered,” making ice less dense.o Water reaches its greatest density at 4°C.o If ice sank, all bodies of water would eventually freeze solid, making life impossible on Earth.The Solvent of Lifeo A solution is a liquid that is a homogeneous mixture of substances.o A solvent is the dissolving agent of a solution.o The solute is the substance that is dissolved.o An aqueous solution is one in which water is the solvent. o Water is a versatile solvent due to its polarity, which allows it to form hydrogen bonds easily.o When an ionic compound is dissolved in water, each ion is surrounded by a sphere of water molecules called a hydration shell. o Water can also dissolve compounds made of nonionic polar molecules.o Even large polar molecules such as proteins can dissolve in water if they have ionic and polar regions.Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substanceso A hydrophilic substance is one that has an affinity for water.o A hydrophobic substance is one that does not have an affinity for water.o Oil molecules are hydrophobic because they have relatively nonpolar bonds.o A colloid is a stable suspension of fine particles in a liquid.Solute Concentration in Aqueous Solutionso Most biochemical reactions occur in water.o Chemical reactions depend on collisions of molecules and therefore on the concentration of solutes in an aqueous solution.o Molecular mass is the sum of all masses of all atoms in a molecule.o Numbers of molecules are usually measured in moles, where 1 mole (mol) = 6.02 x 1023 molecules o Avogadro’s number and the unit dalton were defined such that 6.02 x 1023 daltons = 1 go Molarity (M) is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.Acidic and Basic conditions affect living organisms:  pHo A hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond between two water molecules can shift from one to the other.o The hydrogen atom leaves its electron behind and is transferred as a proton, or hydrogen ion (H+).  The molecule with the extra proton is now a hydronium ion (H3O+), though it is often represented as H+.  o The molecule that lost the proton is now a hydroxide ion (OH–).o Though statistically rare, the dissociation of water molecules has a great effect on organisms.o Changes in pH:  concentrations of H+ and OH– can drastically affect the chemistry of a cell.Effects of Changes in pHo Concentrations of H+ and OH– are equal in pure water.o Adding certain solutes, called acids and bases, modifies the concentrations of H+ and OH– o Biologists use something called the pH scale to describe whether a solution is acidic or basic (alkaline).Acids and Baseso An acid is any substance that increases the  H+ concentration of a solution.o A base is any substance that reduces the H+ concentration of a solution.The pH Scaleo In any aqueous solution at 25°C the product of H+ and OH– is constant and can be written as :[H+] [OH–] = 10–14o The pH of a solution is defined by the negative logarithm of H+ concentration, written as :pH = –log [H+]o For a neutral aqueous solution:[H+] is 10–7 = –(–7) = 7 o Acidic solutions: pH values less than 7o Basic solutions: pH values greater than 7o pH of 7 = neutralo Most biological fluids have pH values in the range of 6 to 8.Buffers : Stablize the pH of a solutiono The internal pH of most living cells must remain close to pH 7o Buffers are substances that minimize changes in concentrations of H+ and OH– in a solutiono Most buffers consist of a weak acid-base pair that reversibly combines with H+Threats to Water Quality on Eartho Acid precipitation refers to rain, snow, or fog with a pH lower than 5.6  Acid rain: pH < 5.6o Acid precipitation is caused mainly by the mixing of different pollutants with water in the air and can fall at some distance from the source of pollutants.o Acid precipitation can damage life in lakes and streams.o Effects of acid precipitation on soil chemistry are contributing to the decline of some forests.o Human activities such as burning fossil fuels threaten water quality.o CO2 is released by fossil fuel combustion and contributes to:o A warming of earth called the “greenhouse” effect.o Acidification of the oceans; this leads to a decrease in the ability of corals to form calcified reefs.You should now be able to:o List and explain the four properties of water that emerge as a result of its ability to form hydrogen bonds.o Distinguish between the following sets of terms: hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances; a solute, a solvent, and a solution.o Define acid, base, and pH.o Explain how buffers work.Chapter 4: Carbon and the Molecular Diversity of LifeOverview: Carbon: The Backbone of Lifeo Although cells are 70–95% water, the rest consists mostly of carbon-based compounds.o Carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form large, complex, and diverse molecules because each carbon atom makes 4 bonds.                 o Proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, and other molecules that distinguish living matter are all composed of carbon compounds.Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compoundso Organic chemistry is the study of compounds that contain carbon.o Organic compounds range from simple molecules to colossal ones.o Most organic compounds contain hydrogen atoms in addition to carbon atoms.Carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding to four other atomso Electron configuration is the key to an atom’s characteristics.o Electron configuration determines chemical bonding:  the kinds and number of bonds an atom will form with other atoms.The Formation of Bonds with Carbono With four valence electrons (outer shell), carbon can form four covalent bonds with a variety of atoms.o This tetravalence makes large, complex molecules possible.o In molecules with multiple carbons, each carbon bonded to four other atoms has a tetrahedral shape.o However, when two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, the molecule has a flat shape.o Carbon atoms partner with other atoms to form compounds such as:o Carbon dioxide: CO2o Urea: CO(NH2)2o Glucose: C6H12O6Molecular Diversity Arising from Carbon Skeleton Variationo Carbon chains form the skeletons of most organic molecules.o Carbon chains vary in length and shape.Hydrocarbonso Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen.o Many organic molecules, such as fats, have hydrocarbon components in long hydrocarbon chains.o Hydrocarbons can undergo reactions that release a large amount of energy.Isomerso Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures and properties:o Structural isomers have different covalent arrangements of their atoms.o Geometric isomers have the same covalent arrangements but differ in spatial arrangements.o Enantiomers are isomers that are mirror images of each other.o Enantiomers, mirror image isomers, are important in the pharmaceutical industry.o Two enantiomers of a drug may have different effects.o Differing effects of enantiomers demonstrate that organisms are sensitive to even subtle variations in molecules. A small number of chemical groups are key to the functioning of biological moleculeso Distinctive properties of organic molecules depend not only on the carbon skeleton but also on the molecular components attached to it.o A number of characteristic groups are often attached to skeletons of organic molecules.  These are called functional groups.The Chemical Groups Most Important in the Processes of Lifeo Functional groups are the components of organic molecules that are most commonly involved in chemical reactions.o The number and arrangement of functional groups give each molecule its unique properties.KEY Functional Groups o The seven functional groups that are most important in the chemistry of life:o Hydroxyl group   -OHo Carbonyl group   -C=Oo Carboxyl group   -COOH o Amino group     -NH2o Sulfhydryl group   -SHo Phosphate group   -OPO32-o Methyl group   -CH3ATP: An Important Source of Energy for Cellular Processeso One phosphate molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is the primary energy-transferring molecule in the cell. o ATP consists of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups.The Chemical Elements of Life: A Reviewo The versatility of carbon makes possible the great diversity of organic molecules.o Variation at the molecular level lies at the foundation of all biological diversity.What is the molecular formula for this organic compound?    Can you build it with a model?You should now be able to:o Explain how carbon’s electron configuration explains its ability to form large, complex, diverse organic molecules.o Describe how carbon skeletons may vary and explain how this variation contributes to the diversity and complexity of organic molecules.o Distinguish among the three types of isomers: structural, geometric, and enantiomer.o Name the major functional groups found in organic molecules; describe the basic structure of each functional group and outline the chemical properties of the organic molecules in which they occur.o Explain how ATP functions as the primary energy transfer molecule in living cells.Chapter 5: The Structure and Function of Large Biological MoleculesOverview: The Molecules of Lifeo All living things are made up of four classes of large biological molecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.o Within cells, small organic molecules are joined together to form larger molecules.o Macromolecules are large molecules composed of thousands of covalently connected atoms.o Molecular structure and function are inseparable.Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomerso A polymer is a long chain-like molecule consisting of many similar building blocks. o These small building-block molecules are called monomers.o Three of the four classes of life’s organic molecules are polymers:o Carbohydrateso Proteinso Nucleic acidsThe Synthesis and Breakdown of Polymerso A condensation reaction or more specifically a dehydration reaction occurs when two monomers bond together through the loss of a water molecule:  dehydration synthesis = build by removing HOH.o Enzymes are organic catalysts = macromolecules that speed up chemical reactions.o Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis:  breaking down by adding HOH.The Diversity of Polymerso Each cell has thousands of different kinds of macromolecules. o Macromolecules vary among cells of an organism, vary more within a species, and vary even more between species.o An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers.Carbohydrates serve as fuel and building materialo Carbohydrates include sugars and the polymers of sugars.o The simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides, or single sugars.o Carbohydrate macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers composed of many sugar building blocks. Sugarso Monosaccharides have molecular formulas that are usually multiples of CH2Oo Glucose (C6H12O6) is the most common monosaccharide.o Monosaccharides are classified by o The location of the carbonyl group (as aldose or ketose)o The number of carbons in the carbon skeleton.o Though often drawn as linear skeletons, in aqueous solutions many sugars form rings.o Monosaccharides serve as a major fuel for cells and as raw material for building molecules. o A disaccharide is formed when a dehydration reaction joins two monosaccharides by removing HOH to form a covalent bond.o This covalent bond is called a glycosidic linkage.o The condensation or dehydration synthesis reaction: C6H12O6  +  C6H12O6   =   C12H22O11 Polysaccharideso Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles.o The structure and function of polysaccharides are determined by their sugar monomers and the positions of the glycosidic linkages.Storage Polysaccharideso Starch is a plant storage polysaccharide. Starch is made of glucose monomers.o Plants store surplus starch as granules within chloroplasts and other plastids. o Glycogen is an animal storage polysaccharide. Glycogen is found in the liver and muscles.Structural Polysaccharideso The polysaccharide cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls.o Like starch, cellulose is a polymer of glucose, but the glycosidic linkages differ.o The difference is based on two ring forms for glucose: alpha (?) and beta (?)	o Polymers with ? glucose are helical.o Polymers with ? glucose are straight.o In straight structures, H atoms on one strand can bond with OH groups on other strands.o Parallel cellulose molecules held together this way are grouped into microfibrils, which form strong building materials for plants.o Enzymes that digest starch by hydrolyzing ? linkages can’t hydrolyze ? linkages in cellulose.o Cellulose in human food passes through the digestive tract as insoluble fiber.o Some microbes use enzymes to digest cellulose.o Many herbivores, from cows to termites, have symbiotic relationships with these microbes.o Chitin, another structural polysaccharide, is found in the exoskeleton of arthropods.o Chitin also provides structural support for the cell walls of fungi.o Unlike starch and glycogen, chitin is a  polysaccharide with nitrogen ( N ) in each sugar monomer.Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic moleculeso Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that do not form polymers.o The unifying feature of lipids is having little or no affinity for water.o Lipids are hydrophobic because they consist mostly of hydrocarbons, which form nonpolar covalent bonds.o The most biologically important lipids are fats, phospholipids, and steroids.Fatso Fats are constructed from two types of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids.o Glycerol is a three-carbon alcohol with a hydroxyl group attached to each carbon.o A fatty acid consists of a carboxyl group attached to a long hydrocarbon chain.o This fatty acid hydrocarbon can be either saturated or unsaturated.o Fats separate from water because water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other and exclude the fats.o In a fat, three fatty acids are joined to glycerol by an ester linkage (covalent bond), creating a triacylglycerol, or triglyceride.o Fatty acids vary in length (number of carbons) and in the number and locations of double bonds.o Saturated fatty acids have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible and no double bonds.  All C - C bonds are single.o Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds   C = Co Fats made from saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats, and are solid at room temperature.o Most animal fats are saturated.o Fats made from unsaturated fatty acids are called unsaturated fats or oils, and are liquid at room temperature.o Plant fats and fish fats are usually unsaturated.o A diet rich in saturated fats may contribute to cardiovascular disease through plaque deposits. o Hydrogenation is the process of converting unsaturated fats to saturated fats by adding hydrogen.o Hydrogenating vegetable oils also creates unsaturated fats with trans double bonds = trans fats.o These trans fats may contribute more than saturated fats to cardiovascular disease.o The major function of fats is energy storage.o Humans and other mammals store their fat in adipose cells.o Adipose tissue also cushions vital organs and insulates the body.Phospholipids  --  Membraneso In a phospholipid, two fatty acids and a phosphate group are attached to glycerol. o The two fatty acid tails are hydrophobic, but the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head.o A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule:  hydrophillic head and hydrophobic tails.o When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into a bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the interior.o The amphipathic structure of phospholipids results in a bilayer arrangement found in cell membranes.o Phospholipids are the major component of all cell membranes.Steroids  =  Lipids  with   4 fused rings …o Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings.o Cholesterol, an important steroid, is a component in animal cell membranes.o Although cholesterol is essential in animals, high levels in the blood may contribute to cardiovascular disease.Proteins have many structures, resulting in a wide range of functionso Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells.o Protein functions include structural support, storage, transport, cellular communications, movement, defense against foreign substances, and organic catalysts (enzymes).o Proteins are polymers called polypeptides.o Amino acids are the monomers used to build proteins.o Enzymes are LARGE proteins that act as  catalysts to speed up the rate of chemical reactions in cells.o Enzymes are specific.  They must have a shape-match with molecules in the chemical reaction.o Enzymes can perform their functions repeatedly, working constantly to carry out the processes of life.Proteins  =  Polypeptideso Polypeptides are polymers built from a set of 20 amino acids (monomers).o The sequence of amino acids determines a protein’s 3D three-dimensional structure.o A protein’s structure determines its function.o A wide variety of proteins can be made from a few monomers by varying the amino acid sequence.Proteins - Amino Acid Monomerso Amino acids are organic molecules with carboxyl and amino groups attached to a central carbon.o Amino acids differ in their properties due to variable side chains, called R groups.  The R group is also attached to the central carbon.o There are 20 different amino acids because there are 20 different side chains.Amino Acid Polymerso Amino acids are linked by covalent bonds called peptide bonds    C - No A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids.o Polypeptides range in length from a few to more than a thousand monomers. o Each polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids.o The sequence of amino acids determines a protein’s three-dimensional structure.o A protein’s structure determines its function.o A functional protein consists of one or more polypeptides twisted, folded, and coiled into a unique shape.o A protein folds into a specific Shape / Structure so it can perform its FunctionFour Levels of Protein Structure -- becoming Functional Proteins:o The primary structure of a protein is its unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.o Secondary structure consists of regular coils and folds in the polypeptide backbone made by hydrogen bonds.o Tertiary structure is determined by interactions among various side chains R groups.o Quaternary structure results when a protein consists of multiple polypeptide chains.o Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain (protein).  This is like the order of letters in a long word. o Primary structure is determined by inherited genetic information (DNA).o The coils and folds of secondary structure result from hydrogen bonds between repeating constituents of the polypeptide backbone.o These regular bonds often make fibrous proteins.o Typical secondary structures are a coil called an ? helix and a folded structure called a        ? pleated sheet .o Tertiary structure is determined by interactions between R groups, rather than interactions between backbone constituents.o These R group interactions fold the polypeptide into a globular shape.o These interactions between R groups include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions. Strong covalent bonds called disulfide bridges may reinforce the protein’s structure.o Quaternary structure results when two or more polypeptide chains form one macromolecule.o Collagen is a fibrous protein consisting of three polypeptides coiled like a rope.o Hemoglobin is a globular protein consisting of four polypeptides: two alpha and two beta chains each with an iron heme group.Sickle-Cell Disease: A Change in DNA and Primary Structureo A slight change in a proteins DNA can change its primary structure (amino acid sequence).  This can affect a protein’s structure and ability to function. o Sickle-cell disease, an inherited blood disorder, results from a single amino acid substitution in the protein hemoglobin.Environmental Factors Affect Protein Structureo In addition to primary structure, physical and chemical conditions can affect protein structure.o Alterations in pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other environmental factors can cause a protein to unravel and loose its native shape.o This shape change is called denaturation.o A denatured protein is biologically inactive.Protein Folding in the Cello It is hard to predict a protein’s structure from its primary structure.o Most proteins probably go through several states on their way to a stable structure.o Chaperonins are protein molecules that assist the proper folding of other proteins.o Scientists use X-ray crystallography to determine a protein’s structure.o Another method is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which does not require protein crystallization.o Bioinformatics uses computer programs to predict protein structure from amino acid sequences.Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary informationo The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a unit of inheritance called a gene.o Genes are unique sequences of DNA nucleotides.o DNA  =  deoxyribonucleic acidThe Roles of  Nucleic Acids = Instructionso There are two types of nucleic acids:o Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)o Ribonucleic acid (RNA)o DNA provides directions for its own replication and the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA)o Through mRNA, DNA controls protein synthesis.o Protein synthesis occurs in ribosomes.The Structure of Nucleic Acidso Nucleic acids are polymers called polynucleotides.o Each polynucleotide is made of monomers called nucleotides.o Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.o The portion of a nucleotide without the phosphate group is called a nucleoside.Nucleotide Monomerso There are two families of nitrogenous bases: o Pyrimidines:  C   T  (U)  (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) have a single six-membered ringo Purines:  A   G  (adenine and guanine) have a 6-membered ring fused to a 5-membered ringo In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose o In RNA, the sugar is ribose.o Nucleotide = nucleoside + phosphate group. Nucleoside = nitrogenous base + sugarNucleotide Polymerso Nucleotide polymers are linked together by dehydration synthesis to build a polynucleotide.o Adjacent nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds that form between the –OH group on the 3? carbon of one nucleotide and the phosphate on the 5? carbon on the next.o These links called phosphodiester bonds create a backbone of sugar-phosphate units. o The sequence of bases along a DNA or mRNA polymer is unique for each gene.The DNA Double Helixo A DNA molecule has two polynucleotides spiraling around an imaginary axis, forming a double helix.o In the DNA double helix, the two backbones run in opposite 5? ? 3? directions from each other, an arrangement referred to as antiparallel.o One DNA molecule includes many geneso The nitrogenous bases in DNA pair-up forming hydrogen bonds:  A - T      and       C - GDNA and Proteins as Tape Measures of Evolutiono The unique linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are inherited, passed from parents to offspring.o Two closely related species are more similar in their DNA sequences (genes) and proteins than are more distantly related species.o Molecular biology compares DNA sequences and can be used to assess evolutionary kinship.You should now be able to:o List and describe the four major classes of organic molecules.o Explain:  monomers,  polymers,  dehydration synthesis with the type of covalent bond for each.o Distinguish between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.  Give examples of each.o Explain lipids in general.  Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fats.
