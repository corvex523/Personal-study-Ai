How to use the dictionary cipher
“Use the second part of Boyer’s Dictionary where the English is placed before the French – it is not paged – you will therefore number the pages beginning with page – Letter A and so on regularly [when you work add five to the number of the page]. There are three columns – distinguish them – a _ under the first figures denotes the first, a _ under the second, the second, and a _ under the third, the third. Count the words from the bottom including the one you use and to the amount add 10…The dictionary I have is the thirteenth edition and was printed in London in the year 1771…” -John Jay
