For the British, the F&I War was a pyrrhic victory
British national debt nearly doubled due to the war. 
The phrase “pyrrhic victory” originates from a quote from Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose triumph against the Romans in the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC destroyed much of his forces, forcing the end of his campaign. It refers to a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat.

Faced with staggering debt, the continued cost of quartering troops in the colonies, and the desire to avoid future conflict with the Indians, Britain ended its practice of salutary neglect.
